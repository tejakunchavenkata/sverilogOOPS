Questions : 
1) Assignments : 
Parent class and child class pointers are initialised , 
-> so why the chile_handle = parent_handle can be done 
-> But not the vice versa 
-> child class has more data than parent class , so assigning child class handle to parent class handle should result in compilation error .

2) parent_handle = child_handle
parent_handle functions can be overwriiten by child_handle using virtual declarations in parentclass functions 
parent_handle functions cannot be overwritten by child_handle , when not declared virtual.

3) Shallow copy and deep copy
